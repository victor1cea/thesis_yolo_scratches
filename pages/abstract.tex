\section*{Abstract}
In industrial 3D printing, defects might appear during the 3D printing process and vision systems are deployed to automate the detection of the defects. The detection task can be optimized by manually engineering the patterns that need to be recognized. However, this is very tedious and time consuming work, so neural networks can be used to solve this task in more robust and automatic manner. \\
The detection tasks in the field of 3D printing are very different in comparison to day-to-day detection of objects, such as cats and dogs. The patterns involved are unique and therefore the training is based on the small dataset on hand. \\
Moreover, the print-jobs require a printing layout for each layer, which are available as images. The goal would is integrate this extra information in the model's training and detection process. \\
